### [Demo - Try it on Expo](https://expo.io/@anlai2/Folio)

## Features

- Users can track their cryptocurrency assets if they are being held cross exchange platforms or in a hardware wallet.
- They can also view current news events in cryptocurrency either through recent tweets or with the Crypto Coin News API
- Folio also allows users to track a portfolio that they might not exactly own. For example, if someone wanted to know how much USD they would hold if they invested x amount today.
